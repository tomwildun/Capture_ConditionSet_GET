# ### Overview

This script facilitates the interaction with an external API to update contracts with specific condition sets based on predefined mappings.

#### Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- The `requests` library (install via `pip install requests`)
- Valid API credentials and an access token

#### Setup

1. Ensure Python and the `requests` library are installed.
2. Obtain valid API credentials and an access token.
3. Replace the `auth_token` variable with your access token.
4. Modify the `contract_mappings` list to match your desired mappings between specific identifiers and condition set names.
5. Run the script.

#### Usage

- Execute the script to update contracts with the specified condition sets according to the defined mappings in `contract_mappings`.
- The script will display responses from the API, indicating the success or failure of each update operation.
- Any contract or condition set specified in the mappings but not found will be added to the `failures` list, which will be printed at the end of the script execution.

#### Notes

- Ensure that the URLs for the API endpoints (`URL` and `condition_set_URL`) are accurate and up-to-date.
- Handle any failures listed in the `failures` list manually, as they may require further investigation or correction of the mappings.
